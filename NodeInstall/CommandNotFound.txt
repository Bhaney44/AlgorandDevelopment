// Command not found

// Several possible causes

// Six common reasons
// 1. the command syntax was entered incorrectly
// 2. the command you are attempting to run is not installed
// 3. the command was deleted, or the system directly was depricated
// 4. the users $PATH is incomplete
// 5. the users $PATH is erroneously set
// 6. the command intended for use is in another location

// Solutions
// 1. Check PATH
// echo $PATH

// 2. Set standard path
// export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin"
